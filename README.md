# Network Programmability Assignment
Example postcodes to test functionality:
```
- Any postcode within the UK
  - e.g. SA1 8AH
- Postcode within the channel islands 
  - e.g. JE1 0FS
  - Channel Island postcodes do not have a latitude or longitude 
    within the postcode API and such proved a small challenge when 
    developing the program
- Option 2 within the program
  - This option auto generates a postcode using the API
